Hello World!

You might be wondering what is the deal about the title of this blog. It dates back to my summer internship at the Danish Cancer Institute. There were many ups and downs, only partially my own fault, but this motto was coined by Salvatore Rizza when I got the opportunity to volunteer at a metal music festival *Copenhell*. I was filled with excitement (a first festival of this size after all - and I was still 20 years old at the time) despite the prospect of an 11-hour shift, mainly trashpicking, at the festival.
