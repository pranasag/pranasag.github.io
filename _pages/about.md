Biological agents of different scale make [metabolic] decisions. Single cells, cell (sub)populations, and even multicellular organisms change their behavior both in space and time. These shifts translate to different metabolic strategies, and metabolic specialization – or loss of it. I try to make sense of shifts in metabolism by blending computational models and experimental data, and my [current research line(s)](projects/) can be summarized as an effort to advance our understanding of different strategies of *life* using the computational blueprints of living cells.

These computational blueprints of metabolism are so-called [genome-scale metabolic models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799321001703) – a technique that I have used in my work extensively over the years. I have accumulated experience in handling these models at all research stages (model construction, development of new pipelines, hypothesis testing), and used their predictions to obtain new biological insights both into microbial physiology. The next frontier - and increasingly bigger chunk of my workday - is transferring the modeling success(es) beyond unicellular organisms.

I am a post-doctoral researcher @[Systems Biology Lab](https://teusinkbruggemanlab.nl) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I am a biochemist by training, and, fascinated by the power that mathematics and computers bring to modern biology, I moved towards computational systems biology over the years. In early 2023, I have defended my [PhD Thesis](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/constrain-and-conquer-explaining-metabolic-strategies-of-microbia) here at the *Vrije Universiteit*.
