Biological agents of different scale make [metabolic] decisions. Single cells, cell (sub)populations, and even multicellular organisms change their behavior both in space and time, and these shifts translate to different metabolic strategies, and metabolic specialization – or loss of it. I try to make sense of shifts in metabolism by blending computational models and experimental data: this way we can get a truly detailed quantitative descriptions into condition- and context-dependent metabolic strategies of different organisms. 

In this endeavor, the primary tools of my research are computational blueprints of metabolism, so-called genome-scale metabolic models – a technique that I have used in my work extensively over the years. I have experience in handling these models at all research stages (hypothesis testing, model construction, development of new pipelines), and used their predictions to obtain new biological insights into microbial physiology.
