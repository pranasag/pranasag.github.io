There are a number of theoretical projects open for students interested in any of the research topics (both at BSc and MSc level). These involve multiple modeling types (genome-scale metabolic modelling and kinetic modelling) and rely on programming with Python, MATLAB and/or R for data analysis and visualization. Obviously, you are also welcome to bring any interesting reseach question yourself - we love puzzles at the Systems Biology Lab! 

Keep in mind that the students from the Vrije Universiteit have priority in hiring, although students from other universities/HBO are also open for consideration. Please contact me for more details!
