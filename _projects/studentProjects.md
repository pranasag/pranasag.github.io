#### Open vacancies
I can offer a number of projects (wet-lab, computational, mixed; both at BSc and MSc level), which can always be tailored to what *you* want to learn. Inquiries of motivated undergraduate students are most certainly welcome! On the case-by-case basis, there are opportunities to be hired as a student assistant/HiWi too.

Computational internships concern analyzing multi-omics data + reconstructing and handling genome-scale metabolic models, while the wet-lab projects are dedicated for generating metagenomics and/or metatranscriptomics datasets. For **computational** internships, basic skills of at least one of the following programming languages are required: Python, bash, MATLAB and/or R.
