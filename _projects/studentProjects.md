There is a number of theoretical projects open for students interested in any of the research topics (both at BSc and MSc level). Internships involve multiple modeling types (genome-scale metabolic modelling and kinetic modelling) and rely on programming with Python, MATLAB and/or R for data analysis and visualization.

#### Open vacancies
Currently none - multiple projects to be announced in 2025Q4. I am always looking for motivated undergraduate students, please contact me for more details!
