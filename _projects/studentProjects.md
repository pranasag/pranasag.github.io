There is a number of theoretical projects open for students interested in any of the research topics (both at BSc and MSc level). Some of the specific openings will be posted below. 

Internships involve multiple modeling types (genome-scale metabolic modelling and kinetic modelling) and rely on programming with Python, MATLAB and/or R for data analysis and visualization. Obviously, you are also welcome to bring any interesting reseach question yourself - we love puzzles at the Systems Biology Lab! Keep in mind that the students from the Vrije Universiteit have priority in hiring, although students from other universities/HBO are also open for consideration. 
Please contact me for more details!

#### Open positions
##### Correlating genetic and functional variability of enzymes with thermodynamics
MSc Minor/Major, 24-36 EC | both on-site and remote | availability: Summer 2024

Supervisors: Pranas Grigaitis, Frank Bruggeman

Most biochemical processes require protein catalysts – enzymes – to proceed at rates which can sustain life. The catalysis function of these proteins has evolved under (and is still subject to) natural selection as different variants of the enzymes emerge through genetic mutations. Mutations can bring both innovations (improved or novel function) and detrimental damage (loss of function) to the enzymes and thus directly influence cell fitness. We would like to test the hypothesis whether the genes, encoding enzymes which catalyze reactions close to thermodynamic equilibrium (small \|ΔG\| values) are less prone to accumulate mutations in selected microbial species.

In this project, we want to correlate the functional information of enzymes with their mutational patterns at different levels (gene, transcript, protein) and expression of these enzymes. We have previously developed a routine to compute ΔG values for all known enzyme-catalyzed metabolic reactions from the genome-scale metabolic models. We will collect and use the set of gene-, transcript-, and protein sequences of sequenced microbial isolates and absolute proteome quantification data for reference strains to correlate sequence variability and enzyme expression levels with the thermodynamic parameters. 

We expect you to be experienced in Python scripting and dedicated data handling libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy). Good understanding of core statistical analyses will be needed for analyzing data. Previous experience with setting up command-line bioinformatics routines is an advantage. We offer you an opportunity to gain experience in handling large-scale datasets, and learn how to setup and run complex, multi-step bioinformatics pipelines.
